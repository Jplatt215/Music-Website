## Notes
* This application uses yt-dlp to extract YouTube video titles for composer and composition parsing on the "Index" page. On cloud platforms (e.g., Render) yt-dlp may sometimes fail with an error like: "Sign in to confirm you’re not a bot". This limitation does not occur when running the project locally.
